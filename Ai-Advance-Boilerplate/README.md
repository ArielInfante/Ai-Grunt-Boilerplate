This is the Advanced Boilerplate which contains Shell commands and Git commands. It seperates the grunt task into a folder and the plugins into a folder within the tasks folder.

In this boilerplates it only installs 4 dependencies and the rest is to be grunted by using the grunt shell command which will install all the other dependencies you choose. You could comment out the ones you do not want. By default they are all commented out.

Keep in mind when you run the first shell command to install all the other dependencies. It may look as if it's not doing anything but actually it is installing. It just does not show all the request it makes and installing procedures when you use the npm install.
