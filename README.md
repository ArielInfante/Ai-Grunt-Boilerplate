This is a Boilerplate for Grunt.js inspired by Chris Coyier Grunt Boilerplate. It makes it easier to start a project. There are two folders and it includes the basic template and a more advanced template. I decided to create a Boilerplate when looking to learn Grunt vut every tutorial was pretty much the same. I saw Chris Coyier's screencast and went to his Github but it looked a lot different than his screencast. So I created a basic Boilerplate and advanced Boilerplate with his updated style. Let me know which is your favorite and help me fix it up.
